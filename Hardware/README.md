# Building a Picontosh

This folder contains the STL and STEP files needed to print the case. I printed the front face-down and the rear placed on its back. Both were printed with supports. 

You'll need 2 copies of the screen bracket: these attach to the back of the LCD using the hex standoffs that come with the display before you screw it into the case.
